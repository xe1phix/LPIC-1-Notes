# 108.4. Manage printers and printing

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should be able to manage print queues and user print jobs using CUPS and the LPD compatibility interface.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Basic CUPS configuration \(for local and remote printers\)
* Manage user print queues
* Troubleshoot general printing problems
* Add and remove jobs from configured printer queues

**Terms and Utilities:**

* CUPS configuration files, tools and utilities
* /etc/cups/
* lpd legacy interface \(lpr, lprm, lpq\)

Although much of our communication today is electronic and paperless, we still have considerable need to print material from our computers.

### cups

CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. for macOS® and other UNIX®-like operating systems.It stands  for Common UNIX Printing System. The CUPS system can act as a printer server for a local machine or a network of machines.

CUPS consists of:

* Print spooler/scheduler: Lines up printing jobs to be sent to the printer.
* Filter system: Converts data so that the attached printer can understand and format the data being printed.
* Backend system: Transports data from filters to printer.

> At the heart of the CUPS printing system is the `cupsd` print server which runs as a daemon process.

#### cups web interface

 There are different interfaces for cups like gui , web interfaces and even traditional command line interfaces. Here we show  the CUPS web administration tool \(`http://localhost:631 or http://127.0.0.1:631`\) to search for or add printers.

> If you are asked for a username and password when accessing the CUPS web interface \(localhost:631\), use your login name and password. 
>
> Obviously adding printer requires root access.\(in ubuntu members of cups admin group are accepted too\)

{% hint style="info" %}
We need to know what driver to use for your printer. Not all printers are fully supported on Linux and some may not work at all, or only with limitations. Check  the printer manufacturer’s website or take a look at OpenPrinting.org.
{% endhint %}

### /etc/cups

The /etc/cups directory contains other configuration files related to CUPS \(Fedora 30\).

### lpd legacy interface 

In UNIX and Linux systems, printing initially used the Berkeley Software Distribution \(BSD\) printing subsystem, consisting of a line printer daemon \(lpd\) running as a server, and client commands such as lpr to submit jobs for printing.

Nowadays many of these legacy tools still exist to keep backward compatibility.

| command | usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| lpr | send file to printer |
| lpq | show print jobs |
| lprm | remove print jobs |
| lpc status | show printer status |

 **lpq : q** stands for **queue** and it is use full when we want to see printer jobs

* `-P` : show the jobs of specific printer
* `-a` : show jobs of all printers.

```text
[root@earth ~]# lpq -PHP-LaserJet-p2055d
HP-LaserJet-p2055d is not ready
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
1st     payam    15      Untitled Document 1             13312 bytes
2nd     payam    16      MOP template.docx               16384 bytes
```

> There should be no space between -P and Printer's name! `-Pprintername`

**lpr :**  The simplest way to print any file is to use the `lpr` command and provide the file name. Again use `-P` to specify printer:

```text
[root@earth ~]#  lpr -PHP-LaserJet-p2055d minicom.log 
[root@earth ~]# lpq
HP-LaserJet-p2055d is not ready
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
1st     payam   15      Untitled Document 1             13312 bytes
2nd     payam   16      MOP template.docx               16384 bytes
3rd     root    17      minicom.log                     2048 bytes

```

**lprm :** lprm  removes job\(s\) from the printer's queue. We need to define Job ID for this command, if no Job ID is specified the older job is removed.

```text
[root@earth ~]# lpq
HP-LaserJet-p2055d is not ready
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
1st     payam   15      Untitled Document 1             13312 bytes
2nd     payam   16      MOP template.docx               16384 bytes
3rd     root    17      minicom.log                     2048 bytes
[root@earth ~]# lprm 15
[root@earth ~]# lpq
HP-LaserJet-p2055d is not ready
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
1st     payam   16      MOP template.docx               16384 bytes
2nd     root    17      minicom.log                     2048 bytes
[root@earth ~]# lprm
[root@earth ~]# lpq
HP-LaserJet-p2055d is not ready
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
1st     root    17      minicom.log                     2048 bytes
[root@earth ~]# 
```

> again -P can be used to specify the printer. Also we can use `lprm -Pprintername -` to remove all printer's jobs. And `lprm -` will remove all jobs from the default printer.
>
> Each user can remove his/her own jobs, but root can do any thing!

**lpc**  : we can use lpc status command in order to check the printer health and troubleshoot \(become root for better results!\).

```text
[root@earth ~]# lpc status
HP-LaserJet-p2055d:
	printer is on device 'smb' speed -1
	queuing is enabled
	printing is disabled
	1 entries
	daemon present
```

where 

* **queuing is enabled**: it means that printer will accept new jobs, if it was disabled it won't accept any new job even if the printer was ok.
* **printing is disabled**: means that printer can not actually print on the paper. That happens if the printer is out of ink or paper or experiencing a paper jam.

In my case, my printer is out of paper. But there are some other cups command which might be helpful specially when a problem occurs: 

| command | describe |
| :--- | :--- |
| **cupsaccept** | tells the printer queue to accept new jobs |
| **cupsreject** | tells the printer to reject any new job |
| **cupsenable** | enables the actual/physical printing of the jobs |
| **cupsdisable** | disables the physical printing of the jobs |

 with all commands we can specify printer's name without -P switch !

```text
[root@earth ~]# lpc status
HP-LaserJet-p2055d:
	printer is on device 'smb' speed -1
	queuing is enabled
	printing is disabled
	1 entries
	daemon present
```

Adding some papers :

```text
[root@earth ~]# cupsenable HP-LaserJet-p2055d

[root@earth ~]# lpc status
HP-LaserJet-p2055d:
	printer is on device 'smb' speed -1
	queuing is enabled
	printing is enabled
	1 entries
	daemon present
```

And if we want to disable a printer intentionally, we can mention the reason with -r switch:

```text
[root@earth ~]# cupsreject HP-LaserJet-p2055d -r "Adding more paper"
[root@earth ~]# lpc status
HP-LaserJet-p2055d:
	printer is on device 'smb' speed -1
	queuing is disabled
	printing is enabled
	1 entries
	daemon present
```

that's all!
