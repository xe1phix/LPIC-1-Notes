### BIOS

 The Basic Input/Output System \(BIOS\), \(also known as System BIOS, ROM BIOS \) is a  standard for defining a firmware interface. The BIOS software is built into the PC, and is the first software run by a PC when powered on.

The fundamental purposes of the BIOS are to initialize and test the system hardware components, and to load a bootloader or an operating system from a mass memory device. 

### UEFI

The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface \(UEFI\) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is meant to replace the Basic Input/Output System \(BIOS\) firmware interface. In practice, most UEFI images provide legacy support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even without another operating system!

{% hint style="info" %}
> The original EFI \(Extensible Firmware Interface\) specification was developed by Intel. UEFI is still not widespread and major hardware companies have switched over almost exclusively to UEFI use. Many older and less expensive motherboards also still use the BIOS system.
{% endhint %}

### MBR

A master boot record \(MBR\) is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives. 

The MBR holds the information on how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized on that medium. Besides that, the MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the installed operating systemâ€”usually by passing control over to the loader's second stage. This MBR code is usually referred to as a boot loader.

![](.gitbook/assets/bootloader-mbr.jpg)

**Master Boot records has some short comings:**

* MBR puts all information in first sector of hard disk so if any problem ocures for that sectore, system won't be able to boot up. 
* MBR contains only four entries \(slots\) for four Primary partitions, one of which can be an Extended partition. This partition will contain unallocated space within it where we can create unlimited number of Logical partitions.

![](.gitbook/assets/createpartition-mbrpart.jpg)

* The organization of the partition table in the MBR limits the maximum addressable storage space of a disk to 2 TB. 

Therefore, the MBR-based partitioning scheme is in the process of being superseded by the GUID Partition Table \(GPT\) scheme in new computers. A GPT can coexist with an MBR in order to provide some limited form of a backwards compatibility for older systems. 

### GPT

GUID Partition Table \(GPT\) is a standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical hard disk, using globally unique identifiers \(GUID\).

 Although it forms a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface \(UEFI\) standard, it is also used on some BIOS systems because of the limitations of master boot record \(MBR\) partition tables.

### BIOS vs UEFI

| BIOS\(Basic Input/Output System\) | UEFI\(Unified Extensible Frimware Interface\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Only Supports MBR\( So GPT itself acts like MBR!\) | Native GPT support |
| Sees GPT as a drive with a single MBR partition | Usually need to run in legacy mode ti support MBR |

{% hint style="success" %}
Usually, MBR and BIOS **\(MBR + BIOS\)**, and GPT and UEFI **\(GPT + UEFI\)** go hand in hand. This is required for some systems \(Windows\), while optional for others \(Linux\).
{% endhint %}

### Block devices

A block device is an abstraction layer for any storage device that can be formatted in fixed-size blocks and blocks should be able to be access randomly.

 Examples of block devices include the first IDE or SATA hard drive on our system \(/dev/sda or /dev/hda\) or the second SCSI, IDE, or USB drive \(/dev/sdb\). Use the `ls -l` command to display /dev entries.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# ls -l  /dev/null /dev/sd[a-z] /dev/sr0 /dev/tty0
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root   1, 3 Dec  2  2018 /dev/null
brw-rw----  1 root disk   8, 0 Dec  2  2018 /dev/sda
brw-rw----+ 1 root cdrom 11, 0 Dec  2  2018 /dev/sr0
crw--w----  1 root tty    4, 0 Dec  2  2018 /dev/tty0
```

 The first character on each output line is **b** for a **block** device, such as floppy, CD drive, IDE hard drive, or SCSI hard drive; and **c** for a **character** device, such as a or terminal \(tty\) or the null device.

#### Disk Partitioning

Now that we are introduced you to hard drive layouts \(MBR & GPT\) , lets learn how to create MBR partitions using fdisk and GPT partitions using gdisk.

### fdisk

**fdisk** also known as format disk is a dialog-driven command in Linux used for creating and manipulating disk partition table. It is used for the view, create, delete, change, resize, copy and move partitions on a hard drive using the dialog-driven interface.  
 fdisk allows us to create a maximum of four primary partitions and the number of logical partition depends on the size of the hard disk you are using. It allows the user:

* To Create space for new partitions.
* Organizing space for new drives.
* Re-organizing old drives.
* Copying or Moving data to new disks\(partitions\)

```text
fdsik [options] device
or
fdisk -l [device...]
```

The first thing to do before doing any thing with the disks and partition is to view basic details about all available partition in the system using `-l` option\(ubuntu 16.04\):

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fdisk -l
Disk /dev/sda: 50 GiB, 53687091200 bytes, 104857600 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x101c66bb

Device     Boot     Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type

/dev/sda5       102764544 104855551   2091008 1021M 82 Linux swap / Solaris


Disk /dev/sdb: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```

as you can see we have two disk drives \(sda,sdb\) sda has some partitions on it but sdb is row.

*  **Boot** : The Boot column shows that the first partition, /dev/sda1, has an asterisk **\(\*\)** indicating that this partition contains the files required by the boot loader to boot the system.
*  **Start and End** : The start and end columns list the starting and ending sectors of each partition.
*  **Blocks** : The blocks column lists the number of blocks allocated to the partition.
*  **Id and System** : These columns identify the partition type.

Viewing  Partition\(s\) on a Specific Disk \(sda\) :

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fdisk -l /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 50 GiB, 53687091200 bytes, 104857600 sectors

Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x101c66bb

Device     Boot     Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type

/dev/sda5       102764544 104855551   2091008 1021M 82 Linux swap / Solaris
```

Lets start interactive mode and see all available commands \(sdb\):

**Partition Types**

The partition types can be displayed and changed by using the fdisk utility. A partial list \(most commonly used\) of partition types are:  
 **83: Linux  
 82: Linux swap  
 5: Extended  
 8e: Linux LVM**

```text
Command (m for help): t

### gdisk

We can Manage  GPT Partitions with gdisk. like fdisk, gdisk is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It will automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record \(MBR\) partition table  to the newer Globally Unique Identifier \(GUID\) Partition Table \(GPT\) format, or will load a GUID partition table.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# gdisk /dev/sdb
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1

Partition table scan:
  MBR: MBR only
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: not present


***************************************************************
Found invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR to GPT format
in memory. THIS OPERATION IS POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE! Exit by
typing 'q' if you don't want to convert your MBR partitions
to GPT format!
***************************************************************


Warning! Secondary partition table overlaps the last partition by
33 blocks!
You will need to delete this partition or resize it in another utility.

Command (? for help): ?
b	back up GPT data to a file
c	change a partition's name
d	delete a partition
i	show detailed information on a partition
l	list known partition types
n	add a new partition
o	create a new empty GUID partition table (GPT)
p	print the partition table
q	quit without saving changes
r	recovery and transformation options (experts only)
s	sort partitions
t	change a partition's type code
v	verify disk
w	write table to disk and exit
x	extra functionality (experts only)
?	print this menu

Command (? for help): q

### parted

 The `parted` command is a partition editor that will work with both MBR and GPT formatted disks.

### File System

Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer which is under the operating system that handles the positioning of your data on the storage, without it; the system cannot knows which file starts from where and ends where.

### **File system types**

 Linux supports several different file systems. Each has strengths and weaknesses and its own set of performance characteristics. 

**Ext, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, btrfs and swap**

One important attribute of a filesystem is journaling

**What is journaling?**

Journaling is designed to prevent data corruption from crashes and sudden power loss. Letâ€™s say your system is partway through writing a file to the disk and it suddenly loses power. Without a journal, your computer would have no idea if the file was completely written to disk. The file would remain there on disk, corrupt.

![](.gitbook/assets/createpartition-journaling.jpg)

With a journal, your computer would note that it was going to write a certain file to disk in the journal, write that file to disk, and then remove that job from the journal. If the power went out partway through writing the file, Linux would check the file systemâ€™s journal when it boots up and resume any partially completed jobs. This prevents data loss and file corruption.

Journaling does slow disk write performance down a tiny bit, but itâ€™s well-worth it on a desktop or laptop.

{% hint style="success" %}
Which File System is perfect for you?

 Generally, a journaling filesystem is preferred over a non-journaling one when you have a choice. You may also want to consider whether your chosen filesystem supports _Security Enhanced Linux_ \(or SELinux\).

We must create a file system before you can use any data storage device connected to a Linux computer.

### partitioning

Linux uses the `mkfs` command to create filesystems and `mkswap`command to make swap space.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before you start modifying partitions, there are some important things to remember. You risk losing your existing data if you do not follow these guidelines: 

1. Back up important data before you start 
2. Do not change partitions that are in use 
3. Know your tool
4.  Stop if you do make a mistake
{% endhint %}

### mkfs

The mkfs \(make filesystem\) command is used to create a filesystem.

The `mkfs` command is actually a front end to several filesystem-specific commands such as `mkfs.ext3` for ext3, `mkfs.ext4` for ext4 and `mkfs.btrfs` for btrfs.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# mkfs
mkfifo        mkfs          mkfs.ext2     mkfs.ext4dev  mkfs.msdos
mkfontdir     mkfs.bfs      mkfs.ext3     mkfs.fat      mkfs.ntfs
mkfontscale   mkfs.cramfs   mkfs.ext4     mkfs.minix    mkfs.vfat

root@ubuntu16-1:~# ls /sbin/mk*
/sbin/mkfs         /sbin/mkfs.ext2  /sbin/mkfs.ext4dev  /sbin/mkfs.msdos
/sbin/mkfs.bfs     /sbin/mkfs.ext3  /sbin/mkfs.fat      /sbin/mkfs.ntfs
/sbin/mkfs.cramfs  /sbin/mkfs.ext4  /sbin/mkfs.minix    /sbin/mkfs.vfat

```

various forms of some commands. mke2fs, mkfs.ext2, and mkfs.ext3 are all the same file, while mkfs.msdos and mkfs.vfat are usually symbolic links to mkdosfs.

In order to build the filesystem using mkfs command, the required arguments are   filesystem-type and device-filename:

```text
mkfs [options] [-t type fs-options] device [size]
```

We can either use mkfs._fstype_ commands `mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1`  or we can use mkfs via `-t` option to  specify the format `mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1` and both would have the same results.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Creating filesystem with 5242624 4k blocks and 1310720 inodes

root@ubuntu16-1:~# 
```

If we want  to assign a label to the partition during format progress we should use -L labelname with that :  `mkfs -t ext3 -L MyData /dev/sdb1`

{% hint style="info" %}
For mounting Formatted partition we can either use Partition label or  **UUID**.  **UUID** _is a unique identifier used in partitions to uniquely identify partitions_. to get the UUID of recent created  partition try : `blkid /dev/sdb1`
{% endhint %}

| Partition | Format Type | Sample Command | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /dev/sdb1 | ext4 | mkfs -t ext4 -L data /dev/sdb1 |  Assigns Label,same as mkfs.ext4 |
| /dev/sdb2 | xfs | mkfs -t xfs -i size=512 /dev/sdb2 | telling it to have larger inodes \(normal is 256\) it helps Selinux |
| /dev/sdc1 | ReiserFS | mkfs -t reiserfs /dev/sdc1 | Or you can use `mkreiserfs` command. |
| /dev/sdc2 | vFAT | mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdc2 | Or you can use `mkfs.vfat` command |
| /dev/sdc3 | Btrfs | mkfs -t btrfs /dev/sdc3 | Or you can use  `mkfs.btrfs` command |

### mkswap

 `mkswap`command  makes swap space on a device or in a file. 

```text
mkswap [options] device [size]
```

The device argument will usually be a disk partition \(something like /dev/sdb1\) but can also be a file. 

The Linux kernel does not look at partition IDs, but many installation scripts will assume that partitions of hex type 82 \(LINUX\_SWAP\) are meant to be swap partitions.

So in order to make a swap space first create a partition using fdisk via partition type 82 and then use mkswap:

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:/# mkswap /dev/sdb1
mkswap: /dev/sdb1: warning: wiping old ext3 signature.
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 20 GiB (21473783808 bytes)
no label, UUID=0dcd7e90-4b45-4d5f-808c-320f1e5ba8a3
```

Using the created partition as a swap space requires further step which will be discussed in later lessons.

that's all!
