# 104.2. Maintain the integrity of filesystems

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should be able to maintain a standard filesystem, as well as the extra data associated with a journaling filesystem.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Verify the integrity of filesystems
* Monitor free space and inodes
* Repair simple filesystem problems

**Terms and Utilities:**

* du
* df
* fsck
* e2fsck
* mke2fs
* debugfs
* dumpe2fs
* tune2fs
* XFS tools \(such as xfs\_metadump and xfs\_info\)



In cases when your system crashes or loses power, your filesystems may be left in an inconsistent state, with some changes completed and some not. 

Operating with a damaged filesystem is not a good idea as you are likely to further compound any existing errors.We’ll take a look at  some tools to help us manage such problems.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should always back up your filesystem before attempting any repairs!
{% endhint %}

### fsck

 The main tool for checking and repairing  filesystems is `fsck`, which, like `mkfs`, is really a front end to filesystem-checking routines for the various filesystem types.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck
fsck          fsck.ext3     fsck.fat      fsck.nfs      
fsck.cramfs   fsck.ext4     fsck.minix    fsck.vfat     
fsck.ext2     fsck.ext4dev  fsck.msdos 

root@ubuntu16-1:~# ls /sbin/fsck*
/sbin/fsck         /sbin/fsck.ext3     /sbin/fsck.fat    /sbin/fsck.nfs
/sbin/fsck.cramfs  /sbin/fsck.ext4     /sbin/fsck.minix  /sbin/fsck.vfat
/sbin/fsck.ext2    /sbin/fsck.ext4dev  /sbin/fsck.msdos
```

> Some of these are just links to e2fsck command and they are the same

The fsck command in Linux allows us to manually check for file system inconsistencies,  Fsck command needs to be run with superuser privileges or **root**\(ubuntu 16.04 here\):

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck /dev/sda1
fsck from util-linux 2.27.1
e2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sda1 is mounted.
e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
In order to use fsck the partition should be unmounted, otherwise it might cause damages!
{% endhint %}

Lets simply check file system on an unmounted ext3 partition \(sdb1\) and try to fix errors :

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck /dev/sdb1
fsck from util-linux 2.27.1
e2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sdb1: clean, 11/1310720 files, 126322/5242624 blocks
```

 This command will attempt to check **/dev/sdb1**, and report any errors it finds.The exit code returned by fsck is one of following conditions:

* 0 No errors 
* 1 Filesystem errors corrected 
* 2 System should be rebooted 
* 4 Filesystem errors left uncorrected 
* 8 Operational error 
* 16 Usage or syntax error 
* 32 Checking canceled by user request 
* 128 Shared-library error

 `-N` option just shows what would be executed but do not attempt to repair them:

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck -N /dev/sdb1
fsck from util-linux 2.27.1
[/sbin/fsck.ext3 (1) -- /dev/sdb1] fsck.ext3 /dev/sdb1
```

 `-n`  causes these commands not to fix anything and just show what was going to be done:

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck -n /dev/sdb1
fsck from util-linux 2.27.1
e2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sdb1: clean, 11/1310720 files, 126322/5242624 blocks
```

Normally, **fsck** will skip parts of the filesystem marked as "clean" — meaning all pending writes were successfully made. The **-f** \("force"\) option specifies that **fsck** should check parts of the filesystem even if they are not "dirty". The result is a less efficient, but a more thorough check.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# fsck -f /dev/sdb1
fsck from util-linux 2.27.1
e2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/sdb1: 11/1310720 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 126322/5242624 blocks

```

{% hint style="success" %}
**What are inodes?**

As we said Linux  treating everything as a file \(even the hardware devices\). The keyboard, mouse, printers, monitor, hard disk, processes, even the directories are treated as files in Linux. The regular files contain data such as text \(text files\), music, videos \(multimedia files\) etc. Set aside the regular data, there are some other data about these files, such as their size, ownership, permissions, timestamp etc. This meta-data about a file is managed with a data structure known as an inode \(index node\).
{% endhint %}

> We can also check file systems using their UUID.\(use blkid command \):
>
> ```text
> root@ubuntu16-1:~# blkid /dev/sdb1
> /dev/sdb1: UUID="b9ca56aa-4ea3-4f61-92c8-18c867fd991f" SEC_TYPE="ext2" TYPE="ext3" PARTUUID="4d71bc84-01"

| fsck command example | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| fsck -M /dev/sda1 | prevents  running fsck on mounted filesystem |
| fsck -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 | Check Only a Specific Filesystem Type |
| fsck -y -f /dev/sdb1 | pass “yes” to all the questions to fix |

> For checking  a XFS filesystem, wehave to use xfs\_check command

## Advanced tools

There are several more advanced tools that we can use to examine or repair a filesystem.

#### Tools for ext2 and ext3 filesystems <a id="tools-for-ext2-and-ext3-filesystems"></a>

* **tune2fs:**Adjusts parameters on ext2 and ext3 filesystems. Use this to add a journal
* **dumpe2fs:** shows all super blocks info
* **debugfs:** interactive file system editor

{% hint style="info" %}
**Super Blocks**

 You may be wondering how all these checking and repairing tools know where to start. Linux and UNIX filesystems usually have a _superblock_, which describes the filesystem _metadata_, or data describing the filesystem itself. This is usually stored at a known location, frequently at or near the beginning of the filesystem, and replicated at other well-known locations. You can use the `-n` option of `mke2fs` to display the superblock locations for an existing filesystem.

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# mke2fs -n /dev/sdb1
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sdb1 contains a ext3 file system
	created on Sat Jan 25 22:17:24 2020
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
Creating filesystem with 5242624 4k blocks and 1310720 inodes

	4096000
```
{% endhint %}

### tune2fs

 The ext family of file systems also has a utility called `tune2fs`, which can be used to inspect information about the block count as well as information about whether the filesystem is journaled \(ext3 or ext4\) or not \(ext2\). 

{% hint style="success" %}
The tune2fs command allows you to set assorted filesystem parameters on a mounted ext2 or ext3 filesystem.
{% endhint %}

`-l` shows contents of the filesystem superblock, including the current values of the parameters:

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1

```

> The command can also be used to set many parameters or convert an ext2 filesystem to ext3 by adding a journal using -j option: `tune2fs -j /dev/sdd1`

Also we can use tune2fs for changing or modifying partition label:

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# tune2fs -L myroot /dev/sda1
tune2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
```

### dumpe2fs

dumpe2fs command is used to print the super block and blocks group information for the filesystem present on device.

{% hint style="danger" %}
printed information may be old or inconsistent when it is used with a mounted filesystem. Don’t forget to unmount your partition before using this command.
{% endhint %}

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# dumpe2fs  /dev/sdb1 | grep superblock
dumpe2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
  Primary superblock at 0, Group descriptors at 1-2

  Backup superblock at 4096000, Group descriptors at 4096001-4096002

```

### debugfs

Is an interactive filesystem debugger. Use it to examine or change the state of an ext2 or ext3 filesystem.  It opens the filesystem in read-only mode unless we tell it not to \(with `-w` option\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
 if  the filesystem is mounted,  is alright for inspecting, but **Do not** attempt repair on a mounted filesystem.
{% endhint %}

### xfs\_info

xfs file system has it's own family commands. xfs\_info is the same as tune2fs but for xfs.

{% hint style="success" %}
xfs\_info should be used on a mounted file system.
{% endhint %}

> xfsprogs package must be installed

> In XFS, you can only extend file system and can not reduce it.

### Monitoring free space <a id="monitoring-free-space"></a>

 On a storage device, a file or directory is contained in a collection of _blocks_. Information about a file is contained in an _inode._

> **Reminder :** inodes keeps information such as who the owner is, when the file was last accessed, how large it is, whether it is a directory, and who can read from or write to it. The inode number is also known as the file serial number and is unique within a particular filesystem.

Data blocks and inodes each take space on a filesystem, so we need to monitor the space usage to ensure that your filesystems have space for growth.

### df

The `df`  \(DiskFree\) command is used to find out about the free and used space of file systems.

```text
df [OPTION]...[FILE]...
```

 If no file name is passed as an argument with df command then it shows the space available on all currently **mounted** file systems

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# df

| df command example | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| df -a  |  dislpay all information includes pseudo, duplicate and inaccessible file systems. |
| df -Th /home | Display Information of /home File System |
| df -k or -m or -h | displays information in Bytes, MB , GB |
| df -t ext3 | include specific file system type |
| df -x xfs | exclude specific file system type |

 The `df` command gives information about a whole filesystem. Sometimes you might want to know how much space is used by a specific file or  directory, To answer this kind of question, we  use the `du` command.

### du

 The Linux `du` \(Disk Usage\)  command, used to check the information of **disk usage of files and directories** on a machine.

```text
du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

| useful switch | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -a | write count of all files, not just directories |
| -h  |  human readable Means we can see sizes in Bytes, KB, MB, GB,... |
| -c | grand total usage disk space at the last line |
|  –max-depth=N | go N or fewer sub directories further |
| -s | display only total for each directory |

```text
root@ubuntu16-1:~# du
16	./.aptitude
8	./.cache/dconf
12	./.cache
8	./.config/htop
8	./.config/gedit
8	./.config/dconf
4	./.config/ibus/bus
8	./.config/ibus
36	./.config
4	./.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d
48	./.gnupg
4	./.gconf
12	./.elinks
16	./.ssh
4	./.nano
8	./.local/share
12	./.local
336	./backup
8	./.dbus/session-bus
12	./.dbus
4	./test-space
932	.

root@ubuntu16-1:~# du -sh
932K	.
```

**--time** option is used to display the last modification time in the output of du.

**--exclude=PATTERN** will exclude files that match PATTERN example: `du -ah --exclude="*.txt" /home/payam`
